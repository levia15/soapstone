**Inspiration**
The idea for Soapstone originally came from Dark Souls (a game neither of us has played, but we're both peripherally aware of).

**What it does**
Soapstone is pretty simple! Open the app on your phone, and you'll be given a small selection of quotes for the place you're standing. These quotes can range from the entertaining, to the poignant, to the useful! You'll also be given the option to make your own digital mark, and leave an inscription for the next person to stand in your footsteps.

**How we built it**
The project was built using a React Native frontend, and an Express.js/PostgreSQL backend hosted on Heroku.

**Challenges we ran into**
This was the first time we worked with a hosting company, and it required us to rethink some of the bad habits that you develop in a local environment. As always, styling the front-end was also a challenge.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
This project is the first time we've built something native rather than for the web, and it's pretty cool to build a single app that works on Android, iOS, and even wearable devices!

**What we learned**
This was our first real look into the deployment process, which has been really interesting!

**What's next for Soapstone**
More features, and a touch more stability! We hope to add the option to leave photos as well. We have a few friends who'd like to use the app and we're excited to get it in the hands of real users! We're also thinking of adding support for images.
